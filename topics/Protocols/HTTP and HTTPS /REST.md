# Representational State Transfer

* Specification which tells how a client should ask data from server and how server should respond to the client
* Everything in REST is resource/entity
* How Server internally stores data is totally up to  the server
* But when the client asks for entity/data in a particular format , it should be able to give
* This is the reason it is called Representational state transfer
* Client demands representation of entity in a particular format
* It gels easily with HTTP as HTTP provides GET , PUT , POST AND DELETE methods 
* It defines specification as the url should identify the resource

* Using the same URI for a resource regardless of any operation
* Use verbs , headers and body
* Self descriptive error messages : use HTTP error codes 
* REST is stateless
